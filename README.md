GCNotificationCenter
====================

This is a Custom Notification Center for iOS. It works subclassing a base Notification Center and providing a protocol to implement by the concrete observers. Works with blocks and operation queues, so you can perform any operation without NSNotification objects and without blocking the UI main thread.
